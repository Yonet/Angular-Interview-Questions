* What does this line do:

```ts
@HostBinding('class.valid') isValid;
```

Binds a host element property (here, the CSS class valid) to a directive/component property (isValid).


* Why would you use renderer2 methods instead of using native element methods?

Renderer2 class is an abstraction provided by Angular to manipulate elements without touching directly. Using renderer service will provide us opportunity to be able to execute manipulations in non-DOM environments like native mobile, desktop and web worker rendering.

* How would you control size of an element on resize of the window in a component?
* What would be a good use for NgZone service?

The most common use of this service is to optimize performance when starting a work consisting of one or more asynchronous tasks that don't require UI updates or error handling to be handled by Angular. Such tasks can be kicked off via runOutsideAngular and if needed, these tasks can reenter the Angular zone via run.

* What are the bootstrap options for NgZone? Why would you use them? (Angular 5+)

- Provide your own `NgZone` instance.
- `zone.js` - Use default `NgZone` which requires `Zone.js`.
- `noop` - Use `NoopNgZone` which does nothing. You need to use async filter or manage change detection manually.

* Why would you use renderer methods instead of using native element methods?

You are not sure what the context you are doing the rendering. You might be assuming the browser compilation and native DOM methods to be available but that might not be the case. It is better to be safe and let Angular handle the manupulation for elements.

* How would you protect a component being activated through the router?
* How would you insert an embedded view from a prepared `TemplateRef`?
* What is the difference between @ViewChild() and @ContentChild()?
- @ViewChild and @ContentChild are used to access Child Component from the Parent Component.
- @ViewChild returns the specified element or directive from the view DOM. But it donâ€™t include element that exist within the <ng-content> tag
- Whereas, any element or component that exists within the <ng-content> tag is accessed as @ContentChild.
